# Test Plan Configuration
#
# This configuration file defines a series of error plans for testing
# HTTP error simulations. Each error plan is structured with the
# following fields:
#
# - errorCode: The specific HTTP status code to simulate (e.g., 404,
#   500). This field is mandatory and determines the type of error
#   response to simulate.
#
# - errorRate: The percentage of requests that should result in the
#   specified error. Represented as an integer, it defines how
#   frequently the error should occur among the requests.
#
# - mode: Specifies the mode of operation for sending requests. Valid
#   values are:
#   - "indefinite": Continuously sends requests without a predefined limit.
#   - "fixed": Sends a fixed number of requests as specified by the 'requests' field.
#   - "duration": Sends requests for a specified duration of time.
#
# - duration: Defines the length of time to run the test. This field
#   is used when the mode is set to "duration". The duration should be
#   specified as a string in a format recognized by Go's
#   time.ParseDuration (e.g., "5m", "2h").
#
# - requests: Specifies the total number of requests to send. This
#   field is used when the mode is set to "fixed".
#
# - requestRatePerSecond: Defines the rate at which requests are sent,
#   in terms of requests per second. This allows control over the load
#   and pace of the requests being sent.
#
# - responseDataSize: Specifies the size of the response data for
#   successful requests. The size is represented as a string, such as
#   "50KB" or "100MB". This field determines the volume of data
#   returned in successful responses, allowing for testing of
#   response handling under various data sizes.
#
# Each plan defines a simulation for a specific HTTP error code.
